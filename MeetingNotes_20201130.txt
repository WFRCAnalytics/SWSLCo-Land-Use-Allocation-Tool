FAR - Employment
Density - Housing


TAZ Splits
 - proportional distribution
 - 


200-225 sf per employee, 300-600 sf per employee, flex office


Scenario 1

  BRT
    stop locations - buffer  (within 300 meters for transit stops)

    adding story - marginal
    office is better FAR?? == 3 and 4 story (base) to 5 and 6 story () FAR doesn't see (10-15% on office increases, 10% for BRT compared to 15% in LRT for Scenario 3)
    330 space per employee, 15,000 sf 

    already dense in base south of 13400 South -
    allowable densisites to make it successful
    
    
  
Scenario 2

  access along 90th
  MVC and 90th
    2-3 to 5-6 stories on
    retail and entertainment centers
  
  Realy intensify between 90th and Daybreak
  
  MVC on steroids - 20-30 % increase
    land to west development intensifies

  redevelopment of older commercial
  
  
  
Scenario 3

  light rail extended to Real Stadium
  BRT on 12600 South
  
  light rail and BRT will have same impact (15% for LRT)
  
  intensity of uses at key intersections on 12600 South, mostly built out
  
  Bangerter and 12600
